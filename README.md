### ðŸ”µ [Use title formats with the rating star â˜…](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/tree/main/lms-jivelite-change-font)

> [!NOTE]
> The [Dark Flat Skin](https://github.com/AF-1/jivelite-darkflatskin#dark-flat-skin) applet (piCorePlayer, SqueezePlay, SB Touch) already includes the required font files.

If you want to use the black star character â˜… to display track ratings (LMS **title formats**) on players with a *jivelite* UI (Radio, piCorePlayer, Touch or SqueezePlay), you have to **replace the default font** on these devices with a font that *includes* the black star character (unless you already use the <i>Dark Flat Skin</i>).<br>
Here's how to do it.
